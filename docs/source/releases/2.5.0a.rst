What's new?
===========


Overriding 'get_base_page_queryset()' now effects top-level menu items too 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, if you overrode get_base_page_queryset() on a custom main menu or flat menu model, the page-tree driven part of the menu (anything below the top-level) would respect that, but top-level menu items linking to pages excluded by get_base_page_queryset() would still be rendered.

Now, 'top_level_items' has been refactored to call get_base_page_queryset() to filter down and return page data for items at the top level too, so developers can always expect changes to get_base_page_queryset() to be reflected throughout entire menus.


'MenuItemManager.for_display()' now returns all items, regardless of the status of linked pages
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When sourcing data for a main or flat menu, it doesn't make sense to apply two sets of filters relating to pages status/visibility, so 'for_display' now simply returns ALL menu items defined for a menu, and any unsuitable page links are filtered out in a menu instances 'top_level_items' by calling upon 'get_base_page_queryset'.


Bug fixes & minor changes 
=========================

*   Fixed an issue with runtests.py that was causing tox builds in Travis CI
    to report as successful, even when tests were failing. Contributed by
    Oliver Bestwalter (obestwalter).
*   Updated signature of ``menu_tags.get_sub_menu_items_for_page()`` to improve
    code readability (see below for more details).
*   Updated signature of ``menu_tags.prime_menu_items()`` to improve code
    readability and consistency, and to support additional arguments required
    for new hooks functionality (see below for more details).
*   All calls to ``prime_menu_items`` are made with arguments in the same order.
*   All calls to ``get_sub_menu_items_for_page`` are made with arguments in the
    same order.
*   The ``stop_at_this_level`` argument for the ``sub_menu`` tag has been
    officially deprecated and the feature removed from documentation. It hasn't 
    worked for a few versions and nobody has mentioned it, so this is the first
    step to removing it completely.


Upgrade considerations
======================


If you're overriding 'get_base_menuitem_queryset()' or calling it from elsewhere
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the queryset returned by 'get_base_menuitem_queryset' on menu instances will now return ALL menu items defined for that menu, regardless of the status / visibility of any linked pages. 

Previously, the result was filtered to only include pages with 'live' status, and with a True 'show_in_menus' value.

If you're calling 'get_base_menuitem_queryset' anywhere in your codebase, and are relying on the original method to return the same value as it did before, you will need to apply the additional filters to the queryset, like so:


.. code-block:: python
    
    from django.db.models import Q

    ...

    menu_item_qs = menu.get_base_menuitem_queryset()
    menu_item_qs = menu_item_qs.filter(
        Q(link_page__isnull=True) |
        Q(link_page__live=True) &
        Q(link_page__expired=False) &
        Q(link_page__show_in_menus=True)
    )


If you're overriding 'MenuItemManager.for_display()'
----------------------------------------------------

If you are subclasssing ``MenuItemManger`` to create managers for your custom menu item models, and are relying on the original 'for_display' method to filter out certain links based on linked page's status/visibility, you may wish to revise your code to filter out the pages as before. However, you may find that you don't need to worry about this, as the 'get_base_page_queryset' method on menu instances should filter out the same pages when page data is fetched to attach to menu items.

However, if you really do need 'for_display()' to return the same results as it did before, you should update the 'for_display' method on your custom manager class to apply additional filters, like so:


.. code-block:: python
    
    from django.db.models import Q
    from wagtailmenus.managers import MenuItemManager

    ...

    class CustomMenuItemManager(MenuItemManager):

        def for_display(self):
            qs = super(CustomMenuItemManager, self).for_display()
            qs = qs.filter(
                Q(link_page__isnull=True) |
                Q(link_page__live=True) &
                Q(link_page__expired=False) &
                Q(link_page__show_in_menus=True)
            )
            # Now apply any custom filters
            ...
            # Return queryset
            return qs


If you're calling ``menu_tags.prime_menu_items()`` directly anywhere 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This method is only intended for use by the other methods in ``menu_tags.py``, and shouldn't be used elsewhere. But, if you are calling it directly, it's likely that you will have to update your code to match the methods updated signature.

The method now accepts three new required arguments:

* ``parent_page``: If the calling tag is rendering a sub-menu for children of a given page, you should pass that page object here. Pass ``None`` if no parent page is involved (for example, if rendering the top level of a main or flat menu, where the menu items are defined on each menu)
* ``current_level``: An integer indicating the 'level' or 'depth' that is currently being rendered in the process of rendering a multi-level menu.
* ``max_levels``: An integer indicatiing the maxiumum number of levels that should be rendered for the current menu.

The ``check_for_children`` argument is no longer accepted.

The ``current_page_ancestor_ids`` argument has been renamed to ``curren_ancestor_ids``.

The position of arguments has changed considerably too. If calling the method using positional arguments, you should examine the code to ensure you're passing arguments in the correct order.


If you're calling ``menu_tags.get_sub_menu_items_for_page()`` directly anywhere
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This method is only intended for use by the other methods in ``menu_tags.py``, and shouldn't be used elsewhere. But, if you are calling it directly, it's likely that you will have to update your code to match the methods updated signature.

The following arguments are now required instead of optional:

* ``original_menu_tag``: The name of the tag that was called to initiate rendering of the menu that is currently being rendered. For example, if you're using the ``main_menu`` tag to render a multi-level menu, even though ``sub_menu`` may be called to render subsequent additional levels, 'original_menu_tag' should retain the value ``'main_menu'``
* ``current_level``: An integer indicating the 'level' or 'depth' that is currently being rendered in the process of rendering a multi-level menu.
* ``max_levels``: An integer indicatiing the maxiumum number of levels that should be rendered for the current menu.

The ``ancestor_ids`` argument has been renamed to ``curren_ancestor_ids``.

The position of arguments has changed considerably too. If calling the method using positional arguments, you should examine the code to ensure you're passing arguments in the correct order.
