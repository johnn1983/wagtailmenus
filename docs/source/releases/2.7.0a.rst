What's new?
===========

- Added support for Wagtail 2.0 and Django 2.0
- Dropped support for Wagtail versions 1.8 to 1.9
- Dropped support for Django versions 1.5 to 1.9


Upgrade considerations
======================

- Wagtailmenus now only officially supports Wagtail and Django versions from
  1.10 to 2.0. If you're using anything earlier than that, you should consider
  updating your project. If upgrading Wagtail or Django isn't an option, you 
  should stick with wagtailmenus 2.6 for now, which is a LTS release.

Following the standard deprecation period, the following classes, methods and
behaviour has been removed:

-   The ``wagtailmenus.models.menus.MenuFromRootPage`` class was removed.
-   The __init__() method of ``wagtailmenus.models.menus.ChildrenMenu`` no
    longer accepts a **root_page** keyword argument. The parent page should be
    passed using the **parent_page** keyword instead.
-   The **root_page** attribute has been removed from the 
    ``wagtailmenus.models.menus.ChildrenMenu`` class. Use the **parent_page**
    attribute instead.
-   The ``sub_menu`` template tag no longer accepts a **stop_at_this_level**
    keyword argument.
-   The ``get_sub_menu_items_for_page()`` and ``prime_menu_items()`` methods
    have been removed from ``wagtailmenus.templatetags.menu_tags``.
-   The ``get_attrs_from_context()`` method has been removed from 
    ``wagtailmenus.utils.misc``.
-   The ``get_template_names()`` and ``get_sub_menu_template_names()`` methods
    have been removed from ``wagtailmenus.utils.template`` and the redundant
    ``wagtailmenus.utils.template`` module removed.
